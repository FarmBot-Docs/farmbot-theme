title="Not inlcuded with all v1.5 kits"
content="v1.5 kits shipped before November 1st, 2020 included dowel pins to help better align extrusions. However, due to feedback from customers that the dowel pins were difficult to use, v1.5 kits shipped after November 1st, 2020 replaced the function dowel pins provided with new extra-long **100mm and 140mm nut bars**."
